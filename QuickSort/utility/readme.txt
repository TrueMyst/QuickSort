Organize your Downloads with your own Custom Folders in a few easy steps âœ¨!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Open the 'file_ext.json' file.

Step 2: Here you can create custom folders for specific file extensions by following this format:
    - '.Extension': '[Folder Name]'
    - Note: This will only sort newly added files, not previously sorted ones. So, be careful when making changes!

Step 3: Save the changes you made in the JSON file and run the 'file_sorter.py' script.

Step 4: And that's it! Your downloads are now organized in the custom folders you created.
